# What?

Resonator is a project based on [Rust's crater](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater) (which is one of the coolest projects in existence) that runs ReasonML code instead of Rust code to make sure the ecosystem doesn't break!

This is still a very early rough implementation of that.

If your project intends to continue using ReasonML (`.re`) instead of ReScript (`.res`) feel free to open an issue or a PR to include your project! You can do that by modifying [packages.json](./packages.json)
